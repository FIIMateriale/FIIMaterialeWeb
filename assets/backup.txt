About Me
About me <p>You can see more interesting stuff above. But if you are interested, you can dm me, I don’t byte, hopefully.</p>

About The App
<p>Here is more to talk about so I’m gonna split this section into subsections.</p><p><h4>Frontend</h4></p> <p>The frontend it was originally made with Angular and Material Design as a UI library. In the summer holiday of 2020 I rebuild the app picking React and Bootstrap because React it was the most popular frontend framework at that time and the site was pretty hard to make with material design. A much wiser choice. The app send requests to backend to fetch all the data, cuz I'm not crazy to hardcode all in there. I am trying to keep the code and logic as clean as possible because I don’t want people who see the code to get stuck into a spaghetti code. That's why I decided to split the logic and refactor(ahh, my 'favorite' word) adding a pattern to the app. The app it's deployed on Firebase, which I strongly recommend. It’s very easy to setup and you can easily link it to a custom domain.</p><p><h4>Backend</h4></p> <p>The backend is written with python using Django REST Framework. It was pretty easy to learn. I was choosing this pattern (API) because my desire was to make the frontend and backend separately. This way I could gain more flexibility. I can also call myself a FullStack developer… I’m not showing off, ok just a little. It took me a while to find a way to deploy the backend. I never did that. As you can see this was my first Django | React project. And I remembered that heroku is a good solution for projects like this. I learned that migrations == migraines because I had a lot of database migrations and I didn’t upload them on Heroku. Because it’s an API the process is very simple: the frontend makes a request, the backend process it and return something.</p><p><h4>Authentication</p></h4> <p>The authentication is made with tokens. There are more methods: session, jwt but I choose token authentication because it was simple to implement and it seemed pretty secure.</p>

How this idea appeared?
<p>The idea of this project was born when two students posted a link with their own version of materials on the facebook page. I was in my dormitory room, and I started to think that I could do something more “dynamic”, a website… I am also a pretty competitive person so... I just learned the basics of Angular and it was the perfect time to make something practical with it. And I start coding.</p> <p>In a week I published the first version. For me it looked a little ugly for obvious reasons but I was proud. After a while I saw that I hadn't so much traffic on the website, and I was also familiar with Android Development... so I decided to make an app. I thought that students could remember easily this project if they had an app on their phone. And I started coding again. This time it took me two weeks or so, in that weird period the C0VID. I was very proud when I gained ~60 active installs. It is nice to build something that other people use.</p>

Introduction
<p>The purpose of this project is to help students from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University - Faculty of Computer Science find materials easily such as courses, seminars, and exams. So…, the students will enter to this site when they feel stressed, angry?…um.</p> <p>The materials are stunt mainly by me, but I was helped so thanks to all students who are helping me with these materials. Keep an eye on “more materials” section. I decided to rebuild the whole project with React and Django instead of Angular and Firebase and change the UI from Material Design to Bootstrap. You’ll probably say that there was a lot of time wasted refactoring, but you are wrong and that’s why:. I also changed the site language to english because It felt weird naming things in romanian. The project is "open source" now because... why not. Who's curious how an app like this works, can see the code easily. For now, this app is not opened for contributions mainly because I want to learn how to make FullStack from scratch, and I put this project on my cv as a personal project and I want to get all the credits for the app but shh, it’s between us. The app was first released in 13.02.2020. The new version development started in 23.07.2020 and the beta badge was removed in 20.08.2020.</p>
